        I like hiding messages in other things. Is there such a thing as a "professional steganographer"? IDK. It's good that this is here. It's good that I don't know if you are reading this (you're probably here and you're probably not reading this). It's good not to have to worry about numbers and pairs of eyes looking at these words and brains processing what those eyes see. Bye.

      <h3>
        Taboo names
      </h3>


      <p>There is also a tradition of giving names with unpleasant qualities to children born to a couple whose previous children have died, in the belief that the unpleasant name will mislead evil spirits seeking to steal the child. <i>Muunokhoi</i> 'Vicious Dog' may seem a strange name, but Mongolians have traditionally been given such taboo names to avoid misfortune and confuse evil spirits. Other examples include <i>Nekhii</i> 'Sheepskin', <i>Nergüi</i> 'No Name', <i>Medekhgüi</i>, 'I Don't Know', <i>Khünbish</i> 'Not A Human Being', <i>Khenbish</i> 'Nobody', <i>Ogtbish</i> 'Not At All', <i>Enebish</i> 'Not This One', <i>Terbish</i> 'Not That One'.</p>

      <p>Couples whose previous boys have died, would give female names to their son to mislead the evil spirits. Synchronically, taboo meaning may be stronger or obliterated: <i>Nergüi</i>, for example, is very common and does not immediately raise any association, while <i>Khünbish</i> might semantically be perceived as <i>khün bish</i> (cf. the same phenomenon in German with the unremarkable <i>Burkhart</i> (lit. 'castle-strong') versus the unusual <i>Fürchtegott</i> ('fear-God')).</p>

        One of the most difficult parts of being a cartoonist is being your own editor, since every line affects every other line on the page. Perhaps the single most difficult part, however, is just starting a page. One trick is to make sure you draw something, even one panel, before going to bed; it will raise your spirits and “carry” you over into the next day’s work. Do not wait until you are “in the mood” to draw, or until you “snap out of your funk.” You must force yourself to draw even if it feels joyless and pointless. You will feel better the next morning. Feeling follows behavior, not the other way around, as my therapist constantly has to remind me. Finally, both Seth and Chris Ware have told me this, and I have grudgingly come to realize that they are absolutely right: when you sit down to draw, you should “dress for work.” Have respect for your craft. Put on a pair of pants.

      <p>Aparte de exigirse un alto grado de locura, quedaron fijados los otros dos requisitos indispensables para pertenecer a esa sociedad: junto a que la obra de uno no fuera pesada y cupiera fácilmente en un maletín, la otra condición indispensable sería la de funcionar como una máquina soltera.</p>

      <p>Aunque no indispensables, se recomendaba también poseer ciertos rasgos que eran considerados como típicamente shandys: espíritu innovador, sexualidad extrema, ausencia de grandes propósitos, nomadismo infatigable, tensa convivencia con la figura del doble, simpatía por la negritud, cultivar el arte de la insolencia.</p>

        The slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey.

        And with a shout she'll throw you out,<br />
        And you'll run away from there,<br />

        And there are certain kinds of visual acts which I’m always hoping to stumble upon. Unusual juxtapositions, surprising color combinations, new modes of visual expression…I am always interested by anything graphical that strikes me as (this is difficult to put into words) excitingly wrong. There is a cool-factor to certain images that lie just on this side of disagreeable…pictorial effects that make me think “this will bother a lot of unimaginative people.” Whenever I see something like that, a piece of art or graphic design that has that special kind of wrongness about it, I think “I need to do something like this myself.” Attendant to this is always the feeling of “in the future, this will be done a lot.” In other words, today’s ugly is tomorrow’s beautiful.

        Dear reader, please note that for the sake of clarity (and also to avoid a lawsuit for copyright infringement in the UK) I have removed the following items from this page:
      </p>

      <p>
        I. Several diagrams illustrating my proficiency in a) the art of kissing under rainy circumstances and b) having silly bike accidents (not necessarily in a simultaneous fashion)
      </p>

      <p>
        II. An excruciating account of the multiple times I’ve gotten lost in the city of Madrid in the last three months (including some beautiful maps pointing to the [possible] locations of the events).
      </p>

      <p>
        III. A pretty funny story involving: a fake beard, a pigeon, a Lalo Schifrin’s record and the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (spoiler: the pigeon dies at the end).
      </p>

      <p>
        IV. A short passage on love, loneliness and fate.
      </p>

      <p>
        VIII. A brief explanation of my difficulties dealing with the roman numerals.
      </p>

      <p>
        VI. A serious and straightforward self-description.

      <p> …Then, about five years ago, a friend of mine moved here from Kelowna, British Columbia. She said, <em>You know, in Toronto, friendships are all based around talking. What you do with your friends is you go out for coffee or drinks, or you go to their apartment and you talk about stuff</em>. <em>In Kelowna, what you do with your friends is go swimming</em>. It seemed really beautiful to me that in Kelowna your friends might just be these people who liked floating around in the water with you—that the people floating near you are your friends.</p>
